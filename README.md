# APPagedScrollView
A quick delegate-based paging scroll view class that can handle all the layout for you.

Creating paging scroll views on iOS isn't always the easiest. With APPagedScrollView and it's UITableView-like API with delegates and data sources, you can get off your feet with barely any code.

In addition, there is an `APPagedScrollViewController` that can set up the scroll view for it, which implments the delegate and data source methods so that you can easily override those and provide the data you want.
